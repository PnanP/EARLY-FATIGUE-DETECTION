# EARLY-FATIGUE-DETECTION

By applying computer vision together with deep learning, the physiological blinking patterns of participants can be mathematically extracted as input for a Multi-layer Perceptron model (MLP) to detect the mental state in terms of vigilance, low-vigilance, and fatigued. Although the accuracy only reached 55 percent, the result has proven that there is potential for further research into the field of pre-emptive fatigue detection using endogenous and physiological characteristics. Following this path, the envisioned outlook is a product that can detect early fatigue state in driver and suggest a safe route to a suitable location for recovery or driver change. This product should be independent of a specific car brand and inclusive for all users. This is the base concept of applying the result of the project responsibly. To intuitively grasp key insights, the report can be read in conjunction with the interactive visual dashboard.
